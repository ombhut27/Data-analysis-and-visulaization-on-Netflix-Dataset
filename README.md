# Data-analysis-and-visulaization-on-Netflix-Dataset

In this project I have worked with Netflix dataset and do some analysis with the use of python programming. This netflix data set is based on Movies and Tv shows.

First of all I got the raw data in which I did data Pre-Processing so that data can be normalized in way such that meaningful information can be derived, then with the help of matplolib i used to create some plots like histogram, bar chart, distplot, line chart, heat map etc. Also in this project i worked with pandas and numpy libraries for data analysis.

with the use of above defined libraries I have created some question and tried to solve that question by data analysis.
